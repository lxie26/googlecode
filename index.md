## Coffee!

Coffee is a caffeinated drink made from coffee beans that is popular not only among teens, but also among adults. It has a bitter taste that is often balanced out with things like milk, sugar, and creamer.

Many working adults start their day off with a plain cup of coffee to boost their energy. Teens have gotten more creative and enjoy different flavors and different types of coffee. A popular coffee chain, [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/menu), has provided teens with hundreds and thousands of drink combinations. 

However, everyday people do not really know anything about the different types of coffee, like espresso, macchiatos, and lattes. There are so many to keep track of, but here is a breakdown what the most popular types of coffees are.
